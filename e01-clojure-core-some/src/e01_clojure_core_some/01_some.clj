;; checking if a collection contains a certain value
;;
;; In clojure there's no generic function for checking if a collection contains a certain value (because it's not always efficient to implement -> would require linear scan).
;; Sets do support this operation .
(#{:a :b} :a) ;=> :a
(#{:a :b} :c) ;=> nil
;; sometimes the linear scan is exactly what you want
(some #{:a} [:b :c :d])
(some #{:a} [:b :a :d])


;; as an alternative for "apply or"
(def v [nil false 5 nil 7])
;; suppose you want to find the first value that is truthy
(filter identity v) ;=> (5 7)
(first (filter identity v)) ;=> 5
;; since we have items in vector we would need to expand them
(apply or v) ;=> Can't take value of macro
;; => whenever you find yourself wanting to type "apply or",
;; type "some identity" instead
(some identity v)
